# Bio

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the **Computer Science and Engineering Department** at the **University of California, San Diego**, advised by [**Prof. Yufei Ding**](https://picassolab.squarespace.com/yufei). My current research focuses on **quantum system design** and **quantum error correction**.

# Research Experience

**2025-06 ~ 2023-09: Summer Intern at Quera Computing Inc.**<br>
I contributed to the development of the Bloqade compiler, creating a new placement dialect and a movement dialect to enable more flexible and efficient qubit scheduling. These dialects serve as the foundation for placement- and transport-aware compilation passes, improving both expressiveness and performance of Bloqadeâ€™s compiler infrastructure.

**2023-07 ~ 2023-10: Summer Intern at UCSD Prof. Yufei Ding's Group**<br>

We are building a compiler-centric optimization framework for **quantum computing**. This compiler is capable of  deploying quantum programs onto the hardware based on photonic quantum devices. My work is to optimize the performance of a basic framework proposed by Picasso Lab, OneQ: A Compilation Framework for Photonic One-Way Quantum Computation, from the perspectives of algorithms, diversity in resource states, and physical realism.<br>

# Hobbies

**Jane Austen Enthusiast**

I'd like to recommend Jane Austen's works to every girl intending to know something about marriage and love.  From my perspective, her depiction of love is akin to delicate carving on a small piece of ivory but it is both genuine and imbued with strength.

**A Girl Enjoying Painting**

My passion for art extends beyond Chinese painting, sketching, oil painting, and quick sketches. Here are some of my works.

**Calligraphy Enthusiast**

I started practicing calligraphy at the age of six, and it has become an activity which brings me peace and joy. Here are some of my works.
